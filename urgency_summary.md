# üö® Parliamentary Questions Urgency Detection Analysis

## üìä **Analysis Overview**

The urgency detection system was successfully implemented to identify high-priority parliamentary questions using advanced NLP and machine learning techniques.

## üîç **Methodology**

### **1. Urgency Scoring System**
- **Keyword-based scoring** with three urgency levels:
  - **High Urgency**: urgent, immediate, critical, emergency, crisis, disaster, outbreak, attack, breach, failure
  - **Medium Urgency**: important, significant, serious, concerning, worrying, problem, issue, delay, shortage, risk
  - **Low Urgency**: general, routine, regular, standard, normal, usual, typical, common

### **2. Feature Engineering**
- **Text Analysis**: Keyword detection, sentiment analysis, complexity scoring
- **Temporal Features**: Date-based urgency, recent question weighting
- **Department Weights**: Priority assignment based on department criticality
- **Deputy Activity**: Activity level of questioning deputies
- **Question Indicators**: Time-sensitive, action-required, urgent pattern detection

### **3. Machine Learning Models**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier** 
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Composite Scoring Algorithm**

## üéØ **Key Features Implemented**

### **Urgency Detection Factors:**
1. **Keyword Analysis** - Identifies urgent terminology in questions
2. **Sentiment Analysis** - Measures emotional intensity and concern level
3. **Department Priority** - Weights questions by department criticality
4. **Temporal Urgency** - Recent questions weighted higher
5. **Question Complexity** - Complex questions may indicate higher urgency
6. **Action Indicators** - Questions requiring immediate response
7. **Time Indicators** - Questions with deadlines or time constraints

### **Department Urgency Weights:**
- **High Priority**: Health, Justice, Defence, Finance, Transport
- **Medium Priority**: Education, Housing, Environment, Social Protection
- **Standard Priority**: Other departments

## üìà **Expected Results**

### **Analysis Output:**
- **Urgency Classification**: Low, Medium, High priority questions
- **Top Priority Questions**: Ranked list of most urgent questions
- **Department Analysis**: Which departments have most urgent questions
- **Deputy Analysis**: Which deputies ask most urgent questions
- **Keyword Trends**: Common urgent terminology patterns
- **Temporal Patterns**: Urgency trends over time

### **Visualizations Generated:**
- **urgency_analysis.png** - Static visualizations
- **urgency_analysis_interactive.html** - Interactive Plotly dashboard

## üèÜ **High-Priority Question Identification**

The system identifies questions that are:
- **Time-critical** with immediate response requirements
- **Security-related** involving threats or breaches
- **Health emergencies** requiring urgent attention
- **Financial crises** needing immediate intervention
- **Infrastructure failures** affecting public services
- **Legal matters** requiring urgent resolution

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **NLP Techniques Used:**
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop word removal
- **Pattern Matching**: Regular expressions for urgency indicators
- **Sentiment Analysis**: TextBlob for emotional scoring
- **Keyword Extraction**: Frequency analysis of urgent terms

### **ML Pipeline:**
1. **Feature Extraction** from question text and metadata
2. **Data Preprocessing** and normalization
3. **Model Training** with cross-validation
4. **Performance Evaluation** using accuracy metrics
5. **Prediction Generation** for new questions

## üìã **Benefits of Urgency Detection**

### **For Parliament:**
- **Prioritized Response**: Focus on most critical questions first
- **Resource Allocation**: Efficient use of ministerial time
- **Risk Management**: Identify potential crises early
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor response times to urgent matters

### **For Public:**
- **Transparency**: Clear priority system for public concerns
- **Accountability**: Track urgent issue resolution
- **Engagement**: Understand what matters most to representatives

## üéØ **Next Steps**

The urgency detection system provides a foundation for:
- **Real-time Monitoring** of incoming questions
- **Automated Alerting** for high-priority issues
- **Response Time Tracking** for urgent matters
- **Trend Analysis** of urgency patterns over time
- **Predictive Modeling** for future urgent questions
